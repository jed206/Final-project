<p> Hello, my name is Brandon Cox. I'm a senior at Rutgers, and am already working full time for UPS. This is my second degree, I graduated with a Marketing degree previously. I was a 4 year starter on the football team my first time throught college, and was lucky enough to play beyond college a little bit before diving into a more regular job. Currently I work, am finishing school, and acting on the side for fun and extra money.</p>
