	<h1> About Me: </h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Brandon Cox. I'm a senior at Rutgers, and am already working full time for UPS. This is my second degree, I graduated with a Marketing degree previously. I was a 4 year starter on the football team my first time throught college, and was lucky enough to play beyond college a little bit before diving into a more regular job. Currently I work, am finishing school, and acting on the side for fun and extra money.</p>
<p> I enjoy music both as a listener, and an "artist". I don't actually consider myself an artist, and I don't make my own music, but I do know how to play 5 instruments.</p>
