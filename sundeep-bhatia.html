    <h1> About me:  </h1>
    
    <p>
	My name is Sundeep Bhatia, and I am a student here at Rutgers New Brunswick majoring in Information Technology and minoring in Human Resource Management. I was born in Edison, New Jersey and have resided here in New Jersey for my whole life. My parents immigrated here from India in the 1980s to California originally. However, my dad got a job at AT&T and they moved their headquarters to Holmdel, New Jersey in 1990 and my parents have been here ever since. My birthday is July 16th, 1997 and I am currently 21 years old. I am graduating Rutgers next year in May 2019, and am looking forward to where life takes me. I have two siblings, my brother is 28 and my sister is 29.

I have many hobbies/interests. I wrestled in high school and now I do jiu jitsu and compete in tournaments for it. I enjoy weightlifting and dieting and am going to be taking part in a natural menâ€™s physique show in August 2019. Some of my interests are that I enjoy watching Mixed Martial Arts, such as UFC and Bellator events, and my favorite fighter is Max Holloway. I also love listening to music, and pop punk is my favorite genre. Some of my favorite bands are The 1975, The Story So Far, and A Day To Remember.

	Some fun facts about me are that last summer I drove with my friends from here in New Jersey all the way to California and made many stops on the way. We stopped in Nashville, Tennessee, New Orleans, Lousiana, Houston and Austin, Texas, New Mexico, Las Vegas, and finally Los Angeles, California. It was an extremely eye opening experience that I think everyone should have. Las Vegas was my favorite part because we saw Calvin Harris play at the Ultra Pool, and at night we saw Tiesto at the Hakkasan Night Club.

I also coach people online for natural bodybuilding. I have a few clients right now and I am going to take in more after I graduate. I do this by first asking my clients for their height, current weight, and goals. If they want to lose weight, I give them a diet that keeps them in a caloric deficit while also giving them a weightlifting program. If they want to gain muscle, I give them a caloric surplus diet. This is done by assigning them Macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fat) to follow.
