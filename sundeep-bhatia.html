    <h1> About me: </h1>
    
    <p>
	My name is Sundeep Bhatia, and I am a student here at Rutgers New Brunswick majoring in Information Technology and minoring in Human Resource Management. I was born in Edison, New Jersey and have resided here in New Jersey for my whole life. My birthday is July 16th, 1997 and I am currently 21 years old. I am graduating Rutgers next year in May 2019, and am looking forward to where life takes me. 

I have many hobbies/interests. I wrestled in high school and now I do jiu jitsu and compete in tournaments for it. I enjoy weightlifting and dieting and am going to be taking part in a natural menâ€™s physique show in August 2019. Some of my interests are that I enjoy watching Mixed Martial Arts, such as UFC and Bellator events, and my favorite fighter is Max Holloway. I also love listening to music, and pop punk is my favorite genre. Some of my favorite bands are The 1975, The Story So Far, and A Day To Remember.
