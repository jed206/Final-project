	<h1> About Me: </h1>
	<p>
		My name is Jordan Drab and I am currently a Junior at Rutgers University. I am majoring in Information Technology and minoring in DCIM. I was born May 1st, 1998 and am the oldest child of my family. I grew up in Suffern New York, which is right on the border of New Jersey. I have two younger siblings named Reilly and Callie. Reilly is currently a Freshman at the University of Vermont and Callie is a Freshman in High School. My parents’ names are Kirsten and Michael. My mom grew up on Long Island while my dad grew up in Suffern. They both met in college at C.W. Post on Long Island. My mom does not work anymore but my dad is an Elementary School Gym Teacher and has been for over 20 years now. My sisters and I all had him for gym class, which was something we enjoyed when we were younger. I have two small dogs that are a mix of miniature pinscher that are named Max and Perri. They are brother and sister and can not live without each other.

		A very large part of mine and my family’s lives is Lacrosse. My dad played at C.W. Post and has been my biggest inspiration and supporter. He had a stick in my hand at the age of three and had me playing versus fifth and sixth graders as a third grader. My other sister Reilly started even younger because she had me. In middle school and high school most of my weekends were spent away at a tournament. My dad has been mine and my sisters coach our entire lives. He became one of the Varsity coaches at Suffern my Freshman year. My sister Reilly was moved up to Varsity in eighth grade. The team was nationally ranked and I played in three State Final Four games. My grade played so well together, which helped us all get recruited by colleges. I committed to play Lacrosse at Rutgers my Sophomore year. It never felt real until it was finally move in day three years later. Reilly also got recruited to play Lacrosse and is a member of the team at Vermont. Lacrosse is usually the main topic of conversation at the dinner table, which gets tiring for my poor mom. I actually get to coach my youngest sister Callie because my dad created the travel team called “Cobra Kai” from the Karate Kid. The name was more of a joke at first but it stuck. Now, Callie is in the process of getting recruited and my whole family is along for the ride.

		Although I am very into sports one of my biggest hobbies is fashion and shopping, which I definitely get from my mom. She has the best clothes and style. I can’t really borrow from her though since she is just five foot and I am 5’7’’. In the future I would love to be able to combine fashion in my career with IT.
