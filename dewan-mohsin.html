    <h1> About me: </h1>
<p> Hi, my name is Dewan Mohsin and I’m 21 years old. Most people don’t know what type of name I have when they see it on paper; my first name is Persian, and my last name is Arabic, yet I’m neither of those two descents. I live up in North Jersey which is conveniently about a half hour away from New York City.  I’m from the same town as Fetty Wap, and he’s even visited my school asking people to check out his mixtape before he hit his fame. I’m studying Economics and ITI, and I just finished interning for Prudential, which is where I might end up working for my first job. I’m applying to Ph. D programs, so I plan to work and go to grad school simultaneously.
    </p>
 
<p>
I spend most of my leisure time with my niece and nephews. I’m a huge boxing and mixed martial arts fan. I wrestled in high school and I also like playing tennis. I enjoy baking and am practicing to have the skills of the professional bakers seen on the infomercials. I also enjoy traveling; I plan to visit every state in the country then move on to visiting other countries. I hope to finish screenwriting my show and then produce it someday. I also plan to start my own business that would help out my community in the long run.</p>
