    <h1> About me: </h1>
		<p>
		My name is Michael Sudol and I am currently a senior at Rutgers University - New Brunswick studying Information Technology and Informatics and Digital, Communication, Information, and Media (DCIM). Most people that know me call me by my last name Sudol, which started back in elementary school and followed me into college which I didn't expect. My birthday is on September 30, 1996 and I was born in Nisko, Poland which is in the south-eastern corner of Poland close to Ukraine. I lived in Poland for nearly two years and on August 8th 1998, I moved to the United States with my parents and my brother Mario. Mario is 30 years old and works for U.S Foods as a truck driver.

            I have lived in a small town of a little over 10,000 residents in Northern New Jersey called Wallington which is located in Bergen County for my whole life in the United States. My town has a high population rate of Polish residents and my family and I enjoy living there because it feels similar to back home in Poland. This past January I became a citizen of the United States of America which makes me a dual citizen of here and Poland and I am proud of that.

            After highschool I attended Bergen Community College in Paramus, NJ to get an associates degree. After two years, I transferred to Rutgers in Fall 2017 and have really enjoying Rutgers Univeristy ever since. It is one of the best decisions I have made in my life, I'm having a blast here.

			Growing up I played a lot of soccer until I injured my ankle while playing for my highschool soccer team in 10th grade which resulted in losing my passion for it. I am a huge sports fan and can talk about it for hours with no problem, no matter which sport it is. My favorite teams are the New Jersey Devils (hockey) and unfortnately the New York Jets (football). I do not have a favorite soccer team but I do like to watch Poland's national team play. I would say my favorite sport is hockey because of how intense it is and how much fun it is to experience it live. I enjoy playing any sports when I have free time to do so, playing pond hockey is one of my favorite things to do in the winter back home.

        My favorite music is Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and I enjoy going to big raves/festivals. I began to listen to it about seven years ago and ever since then I've always enjoyed it. Going to big EDM festivals is a lot of fun and I usually try to attend atleast two a year with my friends. My favorite dj is Martin Garrix.
