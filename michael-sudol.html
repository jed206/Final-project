    <h1> About me: </h1>
		<p>
			My name is Michael Sudol and I am a senior at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. Most people that know me call me Mike or by my last name, Sudol. My birthday is on September 30, 1996 and I was born in Poland. In August of 1998, I moved to the United States with my parents and my brother named Mario. I have lived in a small town in Northern New Jersey called Wallington for my whole life in the United States. My town has a high population of Polish residents and I enjoy living there. Last year I became a citizen of the United States of America which makes me a dual citizen of here and Poland.

			Growing up I played a lot of soccer until I injured my ankle which resulted in losing my passion for it. I am a huge sports fan and can talk about it for hours with no problem. My favorite teams are the New Jersey Devils (hockey), New York Jets (football), and the Los Angeles Lakers (basketball). I would say my favorite sport is hockey because of how intense it is and how much fun it is to experience it live. I enjoy playing any sports when I have free time to do so.

        My favorite music is Electronic Dance Music (EDM) and I enjoy going to big raves/festivals. I began to listen to it about seven years ago and ever since then I've always enjoyed it. Going to big EDM festivals is a lot of fun and I usually try to attend atleast two a year with my friends from back home.
